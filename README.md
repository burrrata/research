Exploring quadratic voting mechanisms and how they can help with coordination and centralization problems in crytpoeconomic protocols.

QVACG (quadratic voting anti centralization gadget) takeaways:
- imposing quadratic costs may put pressure on the players of a game to move towards a maximally effecient equilibrium
- the rules that impose that quadratic cost define the eqiulibrium points players move to, and thus the degree of centralization/decentralization
- quadratic costs/benefits can be maximally effective in iterative games that are rolled out indefinitely (incentivizing participants to move to the equilibrium immediately as there no benefit in resisting)

CTMPD (charity through marginal price discrimination) takeaways:
- it seems like in a setting like Charity Through Marginal Price Discrimination the system works in isolation, but would be maximally effective in a setting with multiple participants all putting pressure on each other to opt into a shared mechanism. 
- moving towards a mechanism that can test and compare arbitrary populations
- and then evolve populations to over iterated games (simulating people finding value in a mechanism and adopting it)
Also considering how this could be implimented in the real world, and if the same mechanism might inspire cartell/monopoly type behavior if used for marketing/promotion/upsell mechanisms rather than community building. Attacks and defenses TBD.

- continuing ideas from this thread: https://ethresear.ch/t/conditional-proof-of-stake-hashcash/1301/18
- relevant to marginal price discrimination because it's all about pricing that incentivizes signal > noise and reduces spam/cheating, esp in social contexts and larger games of life.
