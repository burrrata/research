Exploring quadratic voting mechanisms and how they can help with coordination and centralization problems in crytpoeconomic protocols.

So far the main takeaways are:
- imposing quadratic costs may put pressure on the players of a game to move towards a maximally effecient equilibrium
- the rules that impose that quadratic cost define the eqiulibrium points players move to, and thus the degree of centralization/decentralization
- quadratic costs/benefits can be maximally effective in iterative games that are rolled out indefinitely (incentivizing participants to move to the equilibrium immediately as there no benefit in resisting)

Also, it seems like in a setting like Charity Through Marginal Price Discrimination the system works in isolation, but would be maximally effective in a setting with multiple participants all putting pressure on each other to opt into a shared mechanism. 
Exploring how to model that and then impliment it in the real world, however like any tool... this can be weilded to good or evil, so it's important to guard againt discrimination or consolidation of power using the same mechanisms. Attacks and defenses TBD.
